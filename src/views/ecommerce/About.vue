			What started out as a small shop for digital products, Papier Renei
			has grown into a specialty shop carrying a wide variety of Bearly
			Art products and its own line of stationery and crafts.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			But when did Papier Renei actually start and what was its early
			beginnings?
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			It actually just started as a dream of being an artist way back when
			the owner was still a child. After college, she has had a variety of
			non art-related jobs, then transitioned with art freelancing. That's
			when her dream finally came to a start.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			It was back in January of 2022, a creative crafter with the name of
			Gayle got her an idea of distributing Bearly Art products in the
			Philippines. The owner was hesitating at first, but finally gave in
			since Bearly Art products aren't really sold here in our country.
			That's the start of its journey here, and it's selling pretty well.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			The name Papier Renei came to a start when thinking about possible
			business names. Papier is French for the word paper, and Renei comes
			from the owner's name Reneilda. Renei also comes from the name Renee
			which means "reborn", representing the rebirth of the owner's
			career, transitioning from the corporate world into the art business
			venture.
